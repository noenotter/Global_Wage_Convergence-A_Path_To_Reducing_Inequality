## 🔍 Project Overview

This project investigates whether global wage convergence is occurring and whether it offers a viable path to reducing international income inequalities. We construct wage estimates for countries globally using GDP per capita, employment ratios, labor share of income, and working hours. Convergence is tested through β- and σ-convergence, benchmarking against OECD wages.
